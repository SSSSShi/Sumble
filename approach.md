# Team Name Normalization Approach

This is a **multi-stage normalization pipeline** that reduces 6,241 unique team names to 4,215 canonical forms (32.5% reduction) by **combining rule-based text processing with intelligent fuzzy matching**. The approach handles variations in capitalization, punctuation, organizational suffixes (e.g., "team" vs "group"), and acronym usage (e.g., "AIML organization" vs "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning team"). The pipeline processes each company separately to optimize accuracy, since team naming conventions vary by organization. **Key techniques include:** (1) extracting and mapping acronyms to full forms, (2) removing non-meaningful suffixes while preserving core team identity, (3) fuzzy matching with token-set similarity scoring (85% threshold) to cluster similar names while preventing false matches through opposing keyword detection (e.g., "active" vs "passive") and domain-specific prefix validation (e.g., "RF" vs "CPU"), (4) bidirectional validation ensuring important keywords like "system", "analysis", "search" are preserved in canonical names, and (5) maintaining a canonical mapping to ensure consistency. The solution is built with clean, modular Python code using pandas for data handling and RapidFuzz for efficient string matching, making it easily extensible to new companies and scalable to larger datasets. The code prioritizes both accuracy and engineering quality, with clear documentation and a reusable TeamNormalizer class that can be integrated into production pipelines.
